                            Embarking on the journey to create my personal portfolio website was a significant milestone. To accomplish this, I recently adopted Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as my Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Despite being new to VS Code, I quickly discovered its powerful features and user-friendly interface, which played a crucial role in bringing my website to life.

                            Although I have only recently started using VS Code, its intuitive design made the transition smooth and enjoyable. Here's how VS Code has contributed to the development of my portfolio website:

                            <h3>Powerful Features for Efficient Development</h3>
                            <div class="expand-icon">▼</div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="myskill-details" style="display: none;">
                            Even as a newcomer, I found that VS Code offers a range of powerful features that streamline the development process and enhance productivity. Some of the key features I have leveraged include:
                            <p>
                                - Code Editing: VS Code's advanced code editor provides intelligent code completion, syntax highlighting, and error checking, which have been invaluable for ensuring that my code is accurate and efficient.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - Extensions and Customisation: Despite being new to VS Code, I quickly realised the value of its extensive library of extensions. These have allowed me to customise the IDE to suit my needs, from adding support for various languages to enhancing the user interface.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - Version Control Integration: With seamless integration with Git and GitHub, VS Code has made it easy to manage version control directly from the IDE, facilitating efficient code management and collaboration.
                            </p>
