                            Eclipse offers a wealth of features designed to streamline the development process and enhance productivity. Some of the key features I have utilised include:
                            <p>
                                - Advanced Code Editing: Eclipse code editor provides intelligent code completion, syntax highlighting, and real-time error detection, ensuring that my code is both accurate and efficient.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - Integrated Debugger: The built-in debugger in Eclipse has been invaluable for troubleshooting and resolving issues in my code. Its powerful debugging tools help me quickly identify and fix errors, improving the overall quality of my applications.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - Rich Plugin Ecosystem: Eclipse has an extensive plugin ecosystem allows for customisation and extension of the IDE capabilities. I have leveraged various plugins to enhance my development workflow, from version control to additional language support.
