                            <h3>Multiplayer Algebra-Based Snake Game</h3>
                            <div class="expand-icon">▼</div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="myskill-details" style="display: none;">
                            One of my standout projects was creating a multiplayer algebra-based snake game. This project involved using TCP/IP for networking and JavaFX for the graphical user interface. The game not only challenged my coding skills but also helped me understand the intricacies of real-time multiplayer game development.

                    <div class="myskill-item">
                        <div class="myskill-content">
                            <h3>Finch Robot Dance</h3>
                            <div class="expand-icon">▼</div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="myskill-details" style="display: none;">
                            During my studies, I had the chance to work with the Finch robot. One of the most enjoyable projects was programming the Finch to perform a dance routine. This project allowed me to explore the creative side of coding and see how programming can bring robots to life.

                    </div>
        
                    <div class="myskill-item">
                        <div class="myskill-content">
                            <h3>Finch Robot Group Project</h3>
                            <div class="expand-icon">▼</div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="myskill-details" style="display: none;">
                            Another exciting project involving the Finch robot was a group assignment where we programmed the robot to perform various tasks. This project was an excellent opportunity to develop teamwork skills and learn from my peers, while also deepening my understanding of robotics and Java.

                        <div class="myskill-details" style="display: none;">
                            At university, my Java projects became more challenging and intricate. I worked on a variety of assignments that pushed my limits and expanded my knowledge. These projects often required collaboration, advanced problem-solving, and a deep understanding of Java principles.
