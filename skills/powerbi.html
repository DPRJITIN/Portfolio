                        Unleashing the Power of Data with Power BI
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Power BI has been a transformative tool in my data analysis journey, allowing me to create compelling visualisations and interactive dashboards that turn raw data into actionable insights. Here is an overview of how I have harnessed the capabilities of Power BI in various projects:

                            <h3>KPMG Client Presentation with Interactable Dashboard</h3>
                            <div class="expand-icon">▼</div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="myskill-details" style="display: none;">
                            One of the highlights of my experience with Power BI was developing an interactive dashboard for a KPMG client presentation. This project involved:
                            <p>
                                - Data Integration: Combining data from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive view of the client's key metrics.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - Dashboard Design: Creating an intuitive and visually appealing dashboard that made it easy for the client to explore and understand their data.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - Interactivity: Implementing features that allowed the client to interact with the dashboard, drilling down into details and filtering data to find specific insights.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This project was a great success, demonstrating the power of interactive visualisations in making data-driven decisions.

                            During my BSc and data analysis bootcamp, Power BI was a crucial tool in various projects. These experiences provided me with a deep understanding of how to leverage Power BI for different data analysis tasks:
                            <p>
                                - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using Power BI to conduct EDA, identifying patterns and anomalies in the data.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - Data Visualisation: Creating dynamic and informative visualisations that helped to communicate complex data stories effectively.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - Project-Based Learning: Engaging in multiple hands-on projects that enhanced my skills in data manipulation, visualisation, and presentation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                These projects not only honed my technical skills but also taught me the importance of clear and effective communication of data insights.
