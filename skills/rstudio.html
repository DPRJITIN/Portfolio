                            One of the most impactful projects I worked on using RStudio was my MSc dissertation. The project involved modelling the interplay between COVID-19 vaccinations and emerging mutations using real-world data provided by the UK government. This challenging task required:
                            <p>
                                - Data Manipulation: I used RStudio to clean, transform, and organize the data to meet the model's requirements.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - User-Defined Functions: To simulate real-world scenarios accurately, I created custom functions that generated thousands of crucial calculations for the model.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - Simulation: These calculations formed the backbone of my real-world simulation, providing valuable insights into the dynamics between vaccinations and virus mutations.

                            During my BSc, I delved into the realm of IoT security for my final year project. The focus was on intrusion detection using both supervised and unsupervised machine learning models, and RStudio was instrumental in this research. The project included:
                            <p>
                                - Decision Tree
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - Random Forest
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - Naïve Bayes
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - Logistic Regression
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - Multinomial Linear Regression
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                These models were analysed and compared to determine the most effective approach for detecting intrusions in IoT networks.
