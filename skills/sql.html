                        Harnessing the Power of SQL: My Data Journey
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        SQL has been an essential tool in my data toolkit, playing a pivotal role in various projects during my university studies and a data analysis bootcamp. Here's a snapshot of my experiences with SQL:

                </div>
        
                <div class="myskills-grid">
                    <div class="myskill-item">
                        <div class="myskill-content">
                            <h3>University Projects</h3>
                            <div class="expand-icon">▼</div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="myskill-details" style="display: none;">
                            Throughout my time at university, I worked on multiple projects that relied heavily on SQL for database management and data retrieval. These projects ranged from designing relational databases to writing complex queries that extracted valuable insights from large datasets. The hands-on experience I gained during these projects was instrumental in building a strong foundation in SQL and understanding its real-world applications.

                    </div>
        
                    <div class="myskill-item">
                        <div class="myskill-content">
                            <h3>Data Analysis Bootcamp</h3>
                            <div class="expand-icon">▼</div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="myskill-details" style="display: none;">
                            The data analysis bootcamp further solidified my SQL skills. This intensive program focused on practical, project-based learning, where I had the opportunity to tackle various data challenges. Whether it was cleaning and organising data, performing exploratory data analysis, or generating reports, SQL was the backbone of these tasks. The bootcamp experience not only enhanced my technical skills but also taught me how to approach data problems methodically and efficiently.

                            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                            <div class="expand-icon">▼</div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="myskill-details" style="display: none;">
                            Working with SQL has taught me the importance of structured data and efficient querying techniques. SQL has been a critical part of my journey as a data enthusiast. These experiences have prepared me to handle complex data scenarios and deliver actionable insights.
