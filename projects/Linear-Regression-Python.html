                        This project involves developing a linear regression model using the Iris dataset to predict the species versicolor based on physical features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The process includes data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R2 Score. The visualisations and evaluation provide insights into the model's effectiveness and the relationships within the dataset. This project demonstrates the essential steps involved in building a predictive model.

                                Linear Regression is a fundamental statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The goal is to fit a straight line through the data points that best predicts the dependent variable. The simplest form, known as Simple Linear Regression, involves one independent variable and is represented by the familiar equation "y = mx + c", where "y" is the dependent variable, "x" is the independent variable, "m" is the slope, and "c" is the intercept.

                                Linear Regression is widely used because of its simplicity, interpretability, and efficiency. It provides a clear understanding of the relationships between variables and allows for easy interpretation of coefficients. This method is highly effective for making predictions when the relationship between variables is approximately linear. It's also computationally efficient, making it suitable for large datasets. Additionally, Linear Regression serves as a foundation for more complex regression methods, making it a valuable tool in both academic research and industry applications.

                            <h3>Step 1: Importing Libraries and Loading the Dataset</h3>
                            <div class="expand-icon">▼</div>

                            <p>
                                First, we need to import the necessary libraries and load the Iris dataset. Libraries like "pandas" and "numpy" help with data manipulation, while "seaborn" and "matplotlib" are greate for visualisations. "sklearn" provides tools for machine learning.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Next, we explore the dataset to understand its structure and the relationships between different features. Visualisation helps in identifying patterns and anomalies. This step helps in getter a better understanding of the data and its characteristics, which is crucial for building a good model.

                            <p>
                                Prepare the data by converting categorical variables into numerical ones and splitting the data into training and testing sets. This step ensures that the data is in the right format for the model and separates it into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

                            <h3>Step 4: Train the Linear Regression Model</h3>

                            <p>
                                Now, we train the Linear Regression model using the training data. In this step, the model learns the relationship between the features and the target variable from the training data.
                            </p>

                                Finally, we evaluate the performance of the model by comparing the actual and predicted values. We'll use metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R2 Score, and visualise the results.

                                - Mean Squared Error (MSE): The average of the squared differences between the actual and predicted values. Lower values indicate a better fit.

                            <p>
                                - R2 Score: The proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. A score of 1 indicates a perfect fit.
