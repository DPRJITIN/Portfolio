                            During the course, I had the opportunity to work on an industry project with KPMG, which was an incredibly valuable experience. Here are some highlights of the project:
                            <p>
                                - Research and Data Accuracy: Conducted research based on the proposed research question, leading to a 20% increase in data accuracy. This involved thorough data collection and analysis to ensure high-quality results.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - Effective Communication and Team Efficiency: Communicated effectively with group members to delegate tasks, enhancing team efficiency by 30%. Our clear and concise communication ensured that everyone understood their roles and responsibilities, leading to more productive collaboration.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - Standardised Data Set: Combined individual research to create a standardised data set, reducing data inconsistency by around 50%. This standardisation also ensured the integrity of data sources, providing a reliable foundation for analysis.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - Power BI Dashboard Creation: Created a Power BI Dashboard using the data set, resulting in a 25% improvement in data visualisation and reporting. The dashboard was designed in a way that non-technical stakeholders could easily understand the key metrics, facilitating better decision-making.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - Comprehensive Documentation: Developed comprehensive documentation for the operation and maintenance of the solution, which decreased onboarding time for new users by 40%. This documentation ensured that future users could quickly and efficiently understand and utilise the solution.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                - Stakeholder Reporting: Created a report explaining key findings along with relevant metrics, which improved stakeholder decision-making efficiency by 35%. The report provided clear insights and actionable recommendations based on the data analysis.

                            The Skills City Data Analytics Bootcamp and the industry project with KPMG provided a hands-on learning experience that significantly enhanced my data analysis skills. Through this course, I learned the importance of data accuracy, effective communication, and comprehensive documentation. The project with KPMG allowed me to apply these skills in a real-world context, improving my ability to create impactful data visualisations and reports that drive better decision-making.

                                This journey has equipped me with the skills and confidence to tackle complex data analysis projects and contribute effectively to any team. I look forward to applying these skills in my future endeavours and continuing to grow as a data analyst.
